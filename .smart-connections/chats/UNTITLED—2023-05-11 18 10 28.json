In mathematics, a series is the sum of the terms in a sequence, often represented by the symbol Î£ (sigma). A series can be finite or infinite, and can be classified as arithmetic, geometric, or other types depending on the pattern of the terms. Series are used in many areas of mathematics, science, and engineering to model and solve problems."
