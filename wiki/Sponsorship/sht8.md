# Budgeting Plan

## 0 THB

- We can hopefully run the hackathon with the generosity of venue provider.
- Without food sponsor, participants and staffs may have to pay for food themselves.
- But this should not stop us from having fun together!!

## 40,000 THB

- We can produce base swags [Swag & Prizes](https://www.notion.so/Swag-Prizes-227bb23aa2734088b5a98adfb4fa3f04?pvs=21).
- We may be able to provide air conditioning at night for the participants.

## 65,000 THB

- We can independently provide meals and snacks.
- We can add prizes.

## 100,000 THB

- We can have an abundance of both food and swags
