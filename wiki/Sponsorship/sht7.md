# 🙋 What is The Stupid Hackathon?

**The Stupid Hackathon in Thailand** is a collaborative hackathon in Thailand with non-competitive intentions and no focuses on business value.

Our main goal for this hackathon is to get makers to just *have fun* and learn together, through working on any project they can dream of, fostering a community of enthusiastic creators.
