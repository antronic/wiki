When sending proposals to potential sponsors/partners, we need some basic information about what Creatorsgarten is.

Creatorsgarten is a collective of people, both professionals and students, who are united by our love for creating things. We have been running community events since 2017. Our events include meetups, hackathons, camps, and contests.
