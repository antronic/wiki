# About

At its core, Creatorsgarten is a collective and meta-collective composed of creators from various backgrounds and professions.

The movement was initiated in 2017 by a group of programmers to organize "[[Events/sht1|The Stupid Hackathon Bangkok]]," which eventually evolved into "The Stupid Hackathon Thailand" team and community. From 2017 to 2021, "The Stupid Hackathon Thailand" held five annual Stupid Hackathons, two Hacktoberfest Thailand chapters, and several special events, such as "[[Events/ycc1|Young Creators' Camp]]," "[[Events/love|Data Driven Love]]," and "[[Events/codeplearn|Code Plearn.]]"

As the group expanded and hosted more events unrelated to the annual Stupid Hackathon Thailand, it became clear that the name was no longer fitting. Therefore, in the closing session of the [[Events/sht6|sixth Stupid Hackathon Thailand]], the group announced its new name, "Creatorsgarten", which, as a result, also create a more cohesive collective with a more well-defined objective and traits.

With a growing number of members across a diverse range of fields, Creatorsgarten decided to establish guilds aligned with ongoing projects and member interests. These include:

- Stupid Hackathon Thailand: a group working to host an annual Stupid Hackathon Thailand, which primarily consists of high school and university students
- Showdown Space: a group focused on creating recreational coding competitions
- Bangkok Open Source Initiative: a collective formed spontaneously from the Bangkok Open Source Hackathon in 2023, to promote open-source culture and facilitate connections between creators, developers, and civic and government organizations
- Tech Club Circle: a working group that maintains the circle of computer clubs in Thailand
- Creative Coders: an interdisciplinary group of programmers and artists 

The establishment of these guilds within Creatorsgarten has allowed for a more structured approach to projects and collaborations. Each guild has its own unique culture and persona, attracting members with specific interests and skillsets. However, an individual within Creatorsgarten collective may join multiple guilds based on their interests and contributions.
