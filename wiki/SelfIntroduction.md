Creatorsgarten is a collective of people, both professionals and students, who are united by our love for creating things. Since 2017, we have run over 25 community events, which include meetups, hackathons, camps, and contests. Over 1,200 people attended our events, and over 3,000 people are following our events on [Facebook](https://grtn.org/fb). All of our events are free, thanks to the support of our sponsors and partners.
