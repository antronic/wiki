Currently when it comes to dealing with monetary stuffs, especially when dealing with companies, we depend on one of our partners to become a [fiscal host](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts) for us. There have been some discussions about the prospect of incorporating a foundation, so that the group can self-manage all money. Documenting our financials is easy for us because we track all our financial contributions and expenses online and we make our balance tracking sheets public. The hard part may be other legal/paperwork/admistrative/logistics stuff. However our group has many software developers, so there may be some possibility to automate most of it. However there may be other factors. Weâ€™re still not sure whether to start a foundation or not, but this page is here to list the factors/requirements.
