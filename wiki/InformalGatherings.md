An **informal gathering** (or a **lightweight meetup**) is an [[Events|event]] that requires very little preparation.
:::

- [Bingsu.js](https://bingsu.js.org/), post-meetup after-parties friendly for both introverts and extraverts. It can happen after any event. The mechanic is simple; after a meetup, donâ€™t go home just yet. Stay around for a while. Once most people went back, gather the remaining people and invite them for a meal.

- [[Emkay]], a meetup where we eat at MK Restaurant and talk. This may be a standalone event, or it may be a post-meetup after-party as well.

- [[OnsenJS]], where we work remotely at an onsen place. Usually, these places have a cafe area where we can work. Then we can dip into an onsen pool when you need a break or you have to wait for builds to finish.
