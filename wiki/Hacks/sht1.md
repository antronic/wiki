# About

**The Stupid Hackathon Bangkok** is a 2-day collaborative hackathon in Bangkok with no competition or focus on business value whatsoever.

Our main goal for this hackathon is to get developers to just _have fun_ and learn together, through working on any project they want, fostering a community of enthusiastic makers.

This hackathon is [held all around the world](https://gist.github.com/cheeaun/c3fe6cbb11aef1e146a3474dccf63b87), including New York (the original), San Francisco, Rhode Island, Canada, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, UK, Shanghai, Singapore, and… here, Thailand! In spirit of the stupid hackathons worldwide, this event is _non-commercial_ and free to attend.
