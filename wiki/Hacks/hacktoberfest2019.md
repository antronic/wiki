# About

It's Hacktoberfest 2019 — let’s contribute to open-source projects! Hacktoberfest Open Hack Day Bangkok is an event where many communities unite and submit pull requests to GitHub repositories together!

**WHAT IS HACKTOBERFEST?**

Hacktoberfest — brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with DEV — is a month-long celebration of open source software. Maintainers are invited to guide would-be contributors toward issues that will help move the project forward, and contributors get the opportunity to give back to both projects they like and others they've just discovered. No contribution is too small — bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.

**LANGUAGE**

This event will be run in a mixture of English and Thai. Some contents may be in one language, others may be bilingual.

**WHAT WE DO**

When multiple communities join together we can do more things!

- Want peer support? You can come here and work on open source projects with other people!
- Don't know what project to contribute to? We have sharing sessions from many communities. We’ll showcase open source projects that are looking for contributors and also give general tips on contributing to open source.
- Just getting started? Our mentors and participants can help you get your first Pull Request rolling!
- Looking for people to contribute to your open source project? There’s no more perfect opportunity!
- Want to learn? We have talks and workshops throughout the event. You can take a break from coding and join one of our talk/workshop sessions.
- Want to share? We have lightning talks and open space sessions!
- Want to meet more people? Come on in!
