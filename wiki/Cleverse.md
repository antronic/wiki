Additional notes:

- From {% render 'Event', name: 'creativecodingmeetup' %}
  - The normal setup at the venue is susceptible to audio feedback loop (speaker &rarr; mic &rarr; speaker).
    The maximum audio level that does not result in a feedback loop is too quiet (people at the back cannot hear).
    To fix this, some frequencies have to be filtered out using an equalizer and a limiter.
