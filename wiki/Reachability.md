A piece of information is said to be **reachable** if it is easy to find and access. More specifically, information is reachable if there exists a path to it from the home page of a website (or from a search engine). Making information [[public by default]] can help improve reachability.

# Encouraging reachability

Taking advantage of reachability is encouraged. When someone asks for some information, instead of just giving the link to the information directly, do this instead:

1. Make sure the information is reachable.
2. Tell the person how to find this information.

## Example

Let’s say someone asks you for an information:

::Message[do you have an example of a sponsorship proposal documents?]{from=person1}

Instead of…

::Message[yep, i remember there’s one for stupid hack 2. lemme find it first.]{from=person2}
::Message[<https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/The-Stupid-Hackathon-Thailand-2-Information-for-Sponsors--B3CM7BH9WmWR~ehKJ5tRTeLsAg-a2r1HDTr5SKds5kbmXOzH>]{from=person2}
::Message[here you go]{from=person2}

Do this instead:

::Message[yep, i remember there’s one for stupid hack 2]{from=person2}
::Message[to find it, go to our website > events > stupid hackathon thailand #2 > organizer notes]{from=person2}
::Message[there should be a document "information for sponsors" in there]{from=person2}
