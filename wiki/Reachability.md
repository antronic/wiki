A piece of information is said to be **reachable** if it is easy to find and access. More specifically, information is reachable if there exists a path to it from the home page of a website (or from a search engine). Making information [[public by default]] can help improve reachability.

# Taking advantage of reachability

Taking advantage of reachability is encouraged. When someone asks for some information, instead of…

- Just giving the link to the information directly.

…do this instead:

1. Make sure the information is reachable.
2. Tell the person where to find this information.
