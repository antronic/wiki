The **public by default** principle prefers making information available to everyone by default. This is in contrast to the traditional way of keeping information private by default, and only sharing it with a select group of people.

The benefits is that people, whether an organizer or curious visitors, can [[reachability|reach]] or discover the information they need without having to ask for it.

At Creatorsgarten, we encourage [[learn in public|learning in public]]. [Most of our code is public on GitHub](https://github.com/creatorsgarten), and we put information on our [public wiki](/wiki/) as much as possible. For some events, [the income and expense are tracked in a public document](#financial-transparency). We also publish [[feedback]] we receive from event participants on the wiki.

# Financial transparency

For some events, we track the income and expense in a public document. This is to show how the money is spent, and to make it easier for participants to see the financial status of the event. Examples include:

- {% render 'Event', name: 'sht3' %}: [Tracked in Notion](https://stupidhackth3.notion.site/Stupid-Balance-Tracking-Sheet-f33d403a1db94bd8945525ccf452c2e0)
- {% render 'Event', name: 'sht2' %}: [Tracked in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11QtOidKwo30pvibBgYHORpFkSNP9kZi7xnJmcsRGX6s/edit#gid=0)

# Non-public information

Some information is not suitable for public sharing:

- Personal information about event participants
- For a competitive event, the challenge details (albeit only temporarily)
