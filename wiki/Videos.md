# Common audio/video issues

For livestreaming:

- Audio too quiet. Check in OBS that when speaking, the sound level is in the yellow color zone [between -20 and -9 dB](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/nctu56/best_sound_levels_for_obs/)

- Audio output works in one channel only. Check in OBS and make sure that there are 2 volume bars (left and right channel). If the problem from the source cannot be fixed, go to Advanced Audio Settings and make it mono.

For preparing VODs:

- Video and audio not synchronizing. In a video editor software, detach the audio from video, so that they can be moved independently.

- Issues that interrupt the presentation. For example, connectivity problems, technical issues. They might be safe to cut out from the VOD.

# VOD preparation
