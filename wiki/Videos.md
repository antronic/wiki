# Common audio/video issues

For livestreaming:

- Audio too quiet. Check in OBS that when speaking, the sound level is in the yellow color zone [between -20 and -9 dB](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/nctu56/best_sound_levels_for_obs/)

- Audio output works in one channel only. Check in OBS and make sure that there are 2 volume bars (left and right channel). If the problem from the source cannot be fixed, go to Advanced Audio Settings and make it mono.

For preparing VODs:

- Video and audio not synchronizing. In a video editor software, detach the audio from video, so that they can be moved independently.

- Issues that interrupt the presentation. For example, connectivity problems, technical issues. They might be safe to cut out from the VOD.

# VOD preparation

- [Work on preparing VODs are being coordinated on Airtable.](https://airtable.com/shru5fGOzjhHHxo05)

- Each talk goes through several stages before they are published to the YouTube channel.

   1. **Source** ‚Äî Obtain the source material, either recorded in OBS, or downloaded back from Facebook Live. Re-upload it to YouTube (unlisted) for easy viewing, and also upload it to OneDrive for easy downloading by teammates.

   2. **Timestamp** ‚Äî Determine the time range within the source material that contains the talk.

   3. **Slice** ‚Äî Cut the source video around the time range and put it in its own file. This results in a smaller file that‚Äôs easier to work with.

        The [`cut`](https://github.com/creatorsgarten/videos/blob/main/bin/cut) script can be used to cut the video in a lossless manner using ffmpeg. It generates a `.source.mp4` file. One minute of padding is added to the video to account for imprecise timestamps in step 2.

   4. **Fix** ‚Äî Perhaps the most resource-consuming part of this process. Watch the talk to identify the issues in the video, and fix them if possible. For example, cutting out the part where the talk is interrupted by a technical issue, applying noise reduction, fix audio channel issue.

   5. **Upload** ‚Äî The video is uploaded to YouTube (unlisted).

   6. **Publish** ‚Äî The video is published to YouTube as a public video.
