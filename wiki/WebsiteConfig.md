Announcements are for displaying site-wide banner at the top of the page. Useful for displaying current events.
Each announcement will be evaluated according to this criteria:

1. If `enabled` is false, it will not be shown.
2. If `start` is set and the time has not yet arrived, it will not be shown.
3. If `end` is set and the time has passed, it will not be shown.
4. Otherwise, it will be shown.

If many announcements fulfill the criteria, only the first one will be shown.

You can preview the announcement by appending `?previewAnnouncement=<id>` to the URL. For example, `?previewAnnouncement=example`
