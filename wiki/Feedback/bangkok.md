* Gathering and sharing ideas with strangers
* Meeting like-minded people
* overnight hack is Fun af
* Community
* Bangkok Open Source Hackathon is a great way for me and my friends to learn new skills, meet new people and work on interesting projects. I’m sure that many people enjoy the challenge of building something for Bangkok from scratch in a short amount of time. Also, the venue is great.
* Make this a hackathon that nobody cares about a competition or rewards; just want to come and offer help., Ability to connect people with domain experts.

**What are some things we can improve? What did you enjoy the least?**

* No air con
Nighttime is a bit hot. Due to lack of air conditioning.
* I think almost of the activities are great but there’re some issues about food and rest space of participants in Hackathon days
* Air conditioning, Internet connectivity on the hackathon day and food
* YES
* Water in hackathon day
* เพิ่มรายละเอียดของงานเวลางานและก็สิ่งอำนวยความสะดวกของสถานที่จะดีมากเลยครับ
* Drinking water provision.

**Is there anything we can try out next time? Any suggestions?**
