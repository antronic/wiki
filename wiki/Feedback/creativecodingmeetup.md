:::

**What are some things we can improve? What did you enjoy the least?**

- some presentations are too long
- The timeframe and schedule
- Nothing as of now
- 8 speaker maybe too much for a non stop talk. Might need a break between and should control the speaker time. Some take too much time and make the event too late.

:::Message{from=Claude}

- 3 people mentioned issues with **time management**, including long presentations and overall schedule
- 2 people suggested having **breaks** between speakers
- 1 person felt there were **too many speakers** (8) for a non-stop talk
- 1 person recommended speakers explain **technical topics more simply** for non-developers
- 1 person was confused about the availability of **online attendance**
- 1 person suggested **equal time allocation** for each speaker

:::

**Is there anything we can try out next time? Any suggestions?**

- Timing
- Maybe less speaker but add more area for showcase artwork, So audience can walk around or take a look at each specific work and get to know the artist individually instead of everyone sitting and listen to all talk non stop. Most people already left before getting to talk even they are friends.
- Should be able to have some more break time for connection talk.
