- This topic like TailwindCSS contest.
- This event is not too difficult to enjoy ,css bug are always fun ü§£
- View streaming with smooth commentary
- Real-time preview of contestants work
- vibe is pretty laid back and cool - like how chill/soothing/relaxing/friendly it is. also everything is so smooth and well done especially for an online event (discord bots, live preview system, production, voting)
- That moment when 1. the challenging problem is revealed and 2. we see how fast the contestants are able to do it Also, the automated system is carefully developed!
- The challenge is not too easy and too hard, and it allows new face to shine
- Code with Tailwind!
- Love to community and energy of all people.

- I really like the chill atmosphere set by the MCs. With Lodi music playing, and with soothing commentary, it results in a chill vibe that I really dig.
- this activity gathers many people together. challenge is very interesting. Prize is awesome!

**What are somethings we can improve? What did you enjoy the least?**

- Time management

- The level of challenge.
- That countdown time make me so ‡∏•‡πà‡∏Å üòÖ Maybe giving more time would've worked well
- Some text that are irrelevant to css could be prepared in the challenges. Such as username/comments/callout in the instagram post and story challenges as well as arrow in Numpad challenge.

- The complexity of the assignment in qualifier round is not balance, IMOP, qualifier#2 is harder than another but I think that hard to make the fair assignment.
- More production maybe. No that's so fun and excited.
- 19:00 on workday is not good for me üòÖ
- Internal flow when transfer contestant to different channel to join, and leave
- The show itself is entertaining but we can improve it by having more thrilling narration (aka. ‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏¢‡πå‡∏°‡∏ß‡∏¢). Having jingles could make the show more entertaining too. Ending part is a little bit awkward üòÖ
- Being an elimination contest makes some of the contestants have to wait for a long time, or doesn't have the reason to stay in the event until the finals.
- I feel like there is less involvement for eliminated contestants that still wanna play.

- Online event is fine for me, many people may have a lot of limitation, such as I got the covid but I also coding online to join this event. So, for the next event, please keep continue in online too krub :)
- More contest like tailwind contest or modern framework
- Quick data transformation pipeline, something like given some data, then the contestant need to transform it to complete the objective
- Increase the participation of those who are eliminated
- Bigger competition
- I would like some other times to stay online with more sophisticated system while it's already good this time.
- Put timer in the code editor
- I'd be interested in anything related to any frontend competition after this event (Something like CSS Battles). Maybe do something with animation next (Framer Motion or Anime.js).
