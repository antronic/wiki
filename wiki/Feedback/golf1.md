- I enjoy watching people laugh in shocking way as many of developers keeps making surprises by the work they summited to the game system e.g. a dev explored new way of writing the shortest code that even P‚ÄôThai still has no idea about. It‚Äôs very inspiring. Personally, I work in different industry and I was impressed by how experienced developers care about building strong community, organizing event, sponsorship, and giving away the 1st prize he deserves to random dev in community.
- The atmosphere of the event, "Code Golf Party"
- Code golf event in Thailand
- I like that it is not web dev-related event. This become very rare nowadays. I am interested in many language but not so much in web development. Finally I found event that I can attend and enjoy.
