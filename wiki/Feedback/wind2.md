- my sitting position is very hard to see any main screen, 2 screens are stay at the back of me, and another one screen was blocked by a TV ü•≤
- Sitting
- One improvement that could be made is to add a toggle option for text/word wrap in the Text Editor. During the challenge, I found that writing long lines without wrap was quite painful. While some people might prefer this format, having the option to toggle text/word wrap would be greatly beneficial.
- The internet block, sadly

- Create a profile and store the submissions of each attendee (Like Leetcode or Hackerrank)
- Have different person track objectives, to reduce checking mistakes
- Have a clear labelling on which screen is which number because people might get confused and vote for the wrong one
- Contestant shouldn't be revealed until after the vote to ensure fairness and unbiased score
- Have at least 2 rounds per set of contestants to ensure variety of skills measurement before going to the final
- Prepare the scoresheet better. Too much manual work live, I guess.
