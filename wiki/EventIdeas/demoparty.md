<div class="lead">

Do you like to create **procedural art** using code? We would like to run an event that brings together people who are interested in **GLSL, shader art, generative visuals,** and **live coding.**

In the event, we might make a nice generative art using live coding tools like [Bonzomatic](https://github.com/Gargaj/Bonzomatic), [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/), or [GLSL Sandbox](https://glslsandbox.com/), possibly synchronized to music. Then we can share the results, knowledge, and techniques with each other. Or we might play games like [_Shader Showdown_](https://www.facebook.com/shadershowdown) where people play head-to-head against each other to [create a shader within 30 minutes.](https://youtu.be/gmMPvUwyMxA?t=123)
