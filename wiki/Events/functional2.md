Join us for our second functional programming meetup! We'll be introducing the Elm language, a functional language designed for frontend developers, with short talks and mob-programming sessions to try out Elm together.

If you have experience with frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte, you'll get to know how functional programming can be applied to your work, as well as how you can make use of Elm in your next projects! People of all experience are welcome!
