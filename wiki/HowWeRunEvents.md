If you wonder **how we run events**, here's a quick rundown:
:::

:::info
This page describes [[Events#types-of-events|normal events]] that requires _some_ preparation, such as a meetup or a hackathon. We also have [[informal gatherings]] where the contents on this page do not apply.
:::

1. **It starts with the person who wants to run an event.** (This person usually [[DoOcracy|becomes the event host]].) This can happen in a few ways:

   - An existing organizer has an idea for a new event, and decides to run it.

   - In an event’s after-party or an [[informal gathering]], someone there comes up with an idea for an event, and are encouraged by people around them to run it. This is how most of our events start — from another event, thus forming a cycle — because it’s easier to assemble a starting team when you’re already surrounded by people who are interested in running events.

2. **Assembling a team.** The host creates a group chat for the event, and invite people who are interested in helping out. This is usually done in Facebook Messenger.

   - When running an event, some parts of the process may not be fun for you but are fun for others. For example, some people enjoy designing posters, some enjoy writing, etc. Having more people can help distribute the workload and make the event more fun for everyone involved.

   - Sometimes, the host also posts the event concept on social media to see if there are more people who are interested in helping organize the event. This may be easier when the event already has a set date.

   - With many people in the group chat who each are occupied with things in life, it may be hard to get consensus on everything. Embrace [[lazy consensus]] and [[do-ocracy]].

3. **Prepare the event.** The team discusses and prepares the event. This includes:

   - Finding a date and venue. Discuss with others to increase the likelihood that the chosen date and venue are suitable for both the team and the attendees.

   - Finding sponsors. Some events use a cashless model, i.e. sponsors don’t contribute cash, but contribute in-kind, such as providing a venue, food, or drinks. Some events accept monetary sponsorship, but the organizing team needs someone to handle the money.

   - Creating the event page on the wiki [[Events#creating-a-new-event|(instructions)]] and setting up and publishing an event on Eventpop. For tips on making the most of the ticketing system and reducing no-show rate, see our [[ticketing tips]] page. This also involves preparing image assets for the event, which is detailed in the [[event images]] page.

   - Promoting the event, such as posting to [[digital presence|social media]] and [[Thai Tech Calendar]].

   - Finding on-site volunteers.

4. **Run the event.** The team runs the event.

5. **Networking.** After the event, networking is encouraged.

   - We have [Bingsu.js](https://bingsu.js.org/) for this purpose, where we eat and talk with a few people who came to the event, regardless of whether they are an organizer or an attendee. We invite them to our group chat so they can stay in touch with us when we run more events.

   - This is where many of us get inspired to run more events, and the cycle continues.

6. **Document the event.** We document the event in the wiki. This makes it easier for future organizers to learn from past events.

   - This may include updating the [[organizer notes]] and [[feedback]] from attendees.

   - If there are [[videos]], we upload them to our YouTube channel.

   - If people write blog posts about the event, we link to them in our [[coverage]] pages.

# Inception

Before an event can exist, someone has to be inspired to [[do-ocracy|run it]]. This can happen in a few ways:

- An existing organizer has an idea for a new event, and decides to run it.
- During [networking](#networking), someone comes up with an idea for an event and are encouraged by people around them to run it.

# Team assembly

To assemble a team, the host creates a group chat for the event, and invite people who are interested in helping out. This is usually done in Facebook Messenger.

It is encouraged to recruit many people to join the team. This is so that people who are really interested in running this event has a chance to contribute. At the same time, recognize that not everyone will be able to contribute equally or provide commitment.

To recruit more people,

- The host can post the event concept on social media to see if there are more people who are interested in helping organize the event. (This may be easier when the event already has a set date.)
- Organizers can also encourage each other to invite their friends to join the team.

As our events are run by volunteers and everyone has their own priorities, these principles can be helpful:

- [[Do-o-cracy]]: If you want to see something happen, you are encouraged to do it yourself.
- [[Lazy consensus]]: If you don’t object to something, it’s assumed that you agree with it.

# Preparation

To prepare the event, the team discusses and prepares the event. This includes:

- **Finding a date and venue.** Discuss with others to increase the likelihood that the chosen date and venue are suitable for both the team and the attendees.
- **Finding sponsors.** Some events use a cashless model, i.e. sponsors don’t contribute cash, but contribute in-kind, such as providing a venue, food, or drinks. Some events accept monetary sponsorship, but the organizing team needs someone to handle the money.
- **Publishing the event.** This includes creating the event page on the wiki, updating [[Thai Tech Calendar]] with new event information, and setting up and publishing an event on Eventpop.
  - For tips on making the most of the ticketing system and reducing no-show rate, see our [[ticketing tips]] page.
  - To prepare image assets for the event, the details are in the [[event images]] page.
- **Promoting the event.** This includes posting to [[digital presence|social media]] and [[Thai Tech Calendar]].
- **Finding on-site volunteers.** Usually we announce in a central group chat.

# Running the event

The team runs the event. How events are run can vary, but here are some common tips:

- Registration staff uses the [Eventpop Check-in][evp-checkin] app to check in attendees.
- To post links and other stuff, you can edit the [[CurrentEvent]] page attendees’ resources. We have a short link to this page, {% render 'Grtn', path: 'c' %}.

# Networking

After the event, networking is encouraged. This is where many of us get inspired to run more events, and the cycle continues.

- We have [Bingsu.js](https://bingsu.js.org/) for this purpose, where we eat and talk with a few people who came to the event, regardless of whether they are an organizer or an attendee.
- We sometimes invite more people to our Messenger group chat so they can stay in touch with us when we run more events.

# Documentation

We document the event in the wiki. This makes it easier for future organizers to learn from past events.

This may include:

- Updating the [[organizer notes]] with the full timeline.
- After receiving feedback from attendees, publish them on the event’s [[feedback]] page.
- If there are [[videos]], we upload them to our YouTube channel. Then link to them on the event’s page.
- If people create content about the event (e.g. blog posts, videos, photos, review and write-ups on social media), we link to them in our [[coverage]] pages.
- Update venue pages with the information that may be useful for future events. See [[Cleverse]] and [[KPlusBuilding]] for examples.
