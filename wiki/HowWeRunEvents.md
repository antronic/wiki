If you wonder **how we run events**, here's a quick rundown:
:::

1. **It starts with the person who wants to run an event.** (This person usually [[DoOcracy|becomes the event host]].) This can happen in a few ways:

   - An existing organizer has an idea for a new event, and decides to run it.

   - In an event’s after-party or an [[informal gathering]], someone there comes up with an idea for an event, and are encouraged by people around them to run it. This is how most of our events start — from another event, thus forming a cycle — because it’s easier to assemble a starting team when you’re already surrounded by people who are interested in running events.

2. **Assembling a team.** The host creates a group chat for the event, and invite people who are interested in helping out. This is usually done in Facebook Messenger.

   - Sometimes, the host also posts the event concept on social media to see if there are more people who are interested in helping organize the event. When running an event, some parts of the process may not be fun for you but are fun for others. For example, some people enjoy designing posters, some enjoy writing, etc. Having more people can help distribute the workload and make the event more fun for everyone involved.

3. **Prepare the event.** The team discusses and prepares the event. This includes:

   - Finding a date and venue.

   - Finding sponsors.

   - Creating the event page on the wiki [[Events#creating-a-new-event|(instructions)]] and set up an event on Eventpop.

   - Promoting the event, such as posting to [[digital presence|social media]] and [Thai Tech Calendar](https://th.techcal.dev/).

   - Finding on-site volunteers.

4. **Run the event.** The team runs the event.

5. **Networking.** After the event, networking is encouraged.

   - We have [Bingsu.js](https://bingsu.js.org/) for this purpose, where we eat and talk with a few people who came to the event, regardless of whether they are an organizer or an attendee. We invite them to our group chat so they can stay in touch with us when we run more events.

   - This is where many of us get inspired to run more events, and the cycle continues.

6. **Document the event.** We document the event in the wiki. This makes it easier for future organizers to learn from past events.

   - This may include updating the [[organizer notes]] and [[feedback]] from attendees.

   - If there are [[videos]], we upload them to our YouTube channel.

   - If people write blog posts about the event, we link to them in our [[coverage]] pages.
