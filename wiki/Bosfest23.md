title: Bangkok Open Source Festival '23
---

# üëæ Why?
- an opportunity for programmers to build cool projects, explore and contribute, meet each other, and have fun together.
- an opportunity for tech communities to join and work together, promote their group, and expose to new people and audiences.

# ‚≠êÔ∏è Objectives (in brief)
- Connect developers and communities from different circles
- Promote Thai open-source projects and encourage developers to contribute to them
- [üëÄ] Hacktoberfest stopped giving physical swags and their policy prohibits making swags with the Hacktoberfest brand, so why not make our own?

# üèïÔ∏è Swag giving policy [Draft]
- Participants who contribute to open source projects in the *Thai Open Source Web Ring* or join the event within the campaign [or else?] will receive a point
- Participant who reach x point(s) will receive swags from the Bangkok Open Source Festival '23

# üôå Events within the campaign [Draft]
- Hacktoberfest Thailand 2023 [@Phantip]
- Intania Tech Festival [@Thee]
- G0 Hack Club Meetups [@Phoomparin]

# üöÄ Future Plan
- We plan to scale up the campaign to the "Thai Open Source Festival" in 2024 -- nevertheless, people from other provinces in Thailand can still participate in this year's event as well, whether as a contributor, project maintainers, community managers, or else.
