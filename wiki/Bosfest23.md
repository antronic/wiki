title: Bangkok Open Source Festival '23
---

# 👾 Why?
- an opportunity for programmers to build cool projects, explore and contribute, meet each other, and have fun together.
- an opportunity for tech communities to join and work together, promote their group, and expose to new people and audiences.

# ⭐️ Objectives (in brief)
- Connect developers and communities from different circles
- Promote Thai open-source projects and encourage developers to contribute to them
- 👀 Hacktoberfest stopped giving physical swags and their policy prohibits making swags with the Hacktoberfest brand, so why not make our own?
