# Creating a new event

To start a new event:

1. **Pick a slug for the event.** It should be all lowercase.
2. **Create a wiki page.** The page name should be `Events/<slug>`. You can use the following template as a starting point:

```
---
event:
  name:
  location: TBA
  date:
  endDate:
  site:
  unlisted: true
  hosts:
    - Creatorsgarten
---

TBA
```
