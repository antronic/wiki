As a collective with many different initiatives, each with their own uniqueness, there has been separate websites dedicated to each. **[The Creatorsgarten Webring](https://creatorsgarten.org/ring)** serves to bring all our initiatives together under the same umbrella. It also serves to connect our members’ personal websites. There are currently 2 rings:

- **Us & Our Friends** consists of our initiatives’ websites.
- **Creators Ring** consists of our members’ websites.
