Notes for organizers running an event at the 3rd floor of [**K+ Building**](https://www.kasikornbank.com/th/News/Documents/20200402_K+Building_ForAcademic.pdf).
:::

# Internet

- The venue might not provide a Wi-Fi signal, in which case, we need to use mobile internet.
  - AIS mobile network has stronger signal than Dtac inside the building.

# Video

- (To confirm) HDMI input at the left of the stage.
- The stage has an LED screen.
  - The screen is very bright, so dark-themed presentation is recommended.
    - If speaker’s video signal is processed through OBS, we can apply a filter to decrease the brightness.
  - The screen has a 21:9 aspect ratio, 16:9 video signal will be stretched.
    - If speaker’s video signal is processed through OBS, we can stretch the video to 1463x1080 to cancel out the stretching.

# Audio

- (To confirm) XLR output from the venue’s [mixer](https://usa.yamaha.com/files/download/other_assets/6/331296/ql5_en_om_b0.pdf) is available at the left of the stage. Livestreaming crew can use that signal for live streaming.
