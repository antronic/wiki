The [event ideas board](https://creatorsgarten.org/ideas) is a place for us to share potential idea for events and gather feedback.

<details><summary>How to submit a new idea?</summary>

Our event ideas board is built on top of [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/creatorsgarten/discussions/categories/event-ideas).

- **Event organizers** can add ideas to the board. Most of our events are run by a _self-organizing team_ of volunteers, and the person who came up with the idea should be ready to spearhead the event.

- Anyone can discuss about the ideas by adding comments to the discussion.

If you are an event organizer, you can follow these steps to submit a new event:

1. Make sure you are in the [Event organizers](https://github.com/orgs/creatorsgarten/teams/event-organizers) team on GitHub. If not, [send us a pull request](https://github.com/creatorsgarten/configuration/blob/main/index.ts).
