# The Webring Icon

Here is the webring’s icon:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem">
<img src="/images/ring.svg" width="64" height="64" />
<img src="/images/ring-solid.svg" width="64" height="64" />
</div>

Feel free to change the icon’s color or stroke width, as long as it retains the shape design.

If you are also a member of [วงแหวนเว็บ.ไทย](https://webring.wonderful.software/), feel free to use this icon variant, which has the same stroke width and spacing as วงแหวนเว็บ.ไทย’s icon.

<div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem">
<img src="/images/ring-thin.svg" width="64" height="64" />
<img src="https://webring.wonderful.software/webring.black.svg" width="64" height="64" style="opacity: 0.5" />
</div>
