As a collective with many different initiatives, we have separate websites for each initiative. [**The Creatorsgarten Webring**](/ring) serves to bring all the initiative together under the same umbrella. It also serves to connect our members’ personal websites. There are currently 2 rings:

- **Us & Our Friends** consists of our initiatives’ websites.
- **Creators Ring** consists of our members’ websites.
